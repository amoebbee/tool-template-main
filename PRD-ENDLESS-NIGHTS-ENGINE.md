# The Endless Nights Engine
*A World-Agnostic Game System for OnlyWorlds*

## Core Concept: The Witness Engine

A game system that transforms any OnlyWorlds world into an experience of gradual discovery through repetitive, degrading nights. The player always embodies someone small, powerless, and observant - gathering intelligence in worlds where knowledge has weight and every discovery costs something precious.

## Universal Game Pattern

### The Five Questions for Any World

1. **Who is small?** (The Witness Role)
   - Efteling: A thumb-sized cursed Bokkenrijder
   - Raihappa: A sin auditor the size of a conscience  
   - Blood Meridian: A lice-sized scribe in the Judge's beard
   - Your World: Who observes without power?

2. **What has weight?** (The Resource System)
   - Efteling: Oaths, accusations, evidence of trials
   - Raihappa: Degradation points, small surrenders
   - Blood Meridian: Justifications for violence
   - Your World: What information matters?

3. **What degrades?** (The Entropy Pattern)
   - Efteling: Fairy tale logic, color, sound
   - Raihappa: Humanity, form, purpose
   - Blood Meridian: Meaning, memory, mercy
   - Your World: What falls apart over time?

4. **What's the treaty?** (The Diplomatic Layer)
   - Efteling: Accords between fairy tales
   - Raihappa: Agreements between stages of decay
   - Blood Meridian: The compact of violence
   - Your World: What agreements prevent total collapse?

5. **What's hidden?** (The Truth Nobody Admits)
   - Efteling: Everyone might be a Bokkenrijder
   - Raihappa: Degradation is a choice
   - Blood Meridian: Violence has no meaning
   - Your World: What does everyone know but no one says?

## The Engine Architecture

### Phase 1: World Analysis & Adaptation

```javascript
class WorldAdapter {
  constructor(worldId) {
    this.world = new OnlyWorldsWorld(worldId);
    this.witness = null;
    this.resources = [];
    this.degradationRules = [];
  }
  
  async analyzeWorld() {
    // Pull all OnlyWorlds elements
    const elements = await this.world.getAllElements();
    
    // Identify patterns
    this.findPowerStructures(elements);
    this.identifyConflicts(elements);
    this.discoverSecrets(elements);
    
    // Generate witness role
    this.witness = this.createWitnessRole();
    
    // Define resource types
    this.resources = this.extractResourceTypes();
    
    // Build degradation rules
    this.degradationRules = this.defineEntropy();
  }
  
  createWitnessRole() {
    // Find the least powerful conscious entity
    // Make them smaller
    // Give them a reason to observe
    return {
      scale: 'insignificant',
      motivation: 'survival through understanding',
      power: 'seeing what giants miss'
    };
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Resource Weight System

```javascript
class UniversalResourceSystem {
  constructor(worldType) {
    this.resourceTypes = this.defineResources(worldType);
    this.weight = new KnowledgeBurden();
    this.transmutations = new TransmutationEngine();
  }
  
  defineResources(worldType) {
    // Every world has three resource types
    return {
      ephemeral: {
        name: this.getEphemeralName(worldType), // Whispers, Sins, Screams
        decay: true,
        visual: 'floating_text',
        weight: 1
      },
      physical: {
        name: this.getPhysicalName(worldType), // Marks, Scars, Scalps
        decay: false,
        visual: 'world_marking',
        weight: 3
      },
      binding: {
        name: this.getBindingName(worldType), // Oaths, Corruptions, Manifestos
        decay: false,
        visual: 'character_modification',
        weight: 5
      }
    };
  }
  
  // Knowledge has physical weight
  calculateBurden(knowledge) {
    const truthWeight = knowledge.truthValue * knowledge.implications;
    const emotionalWeight = knowledge.personalCost;
    const socialWeight = knowledge.relationships.length;
    
    return {
      total: truthWeight + emotionalWeight + socialWeight,
      speedReduction: Math.log(truthWeight),
      visionReduction: emotionalWeight * 0.1,
      socialIsolation: socialWeight > 5
    };
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: The Living Map System

```javascript
class IntelligenceMap {
  constructor(worldId) {
    this.canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    this.worldId = worldId;
    this.tissue = new LivingTissue(); // The map that breathes
  }
  
  // The map physically reacts to information
  recordDiscovery(discovery) {
    const location = this.worldToMapCoordinates(discovery.location);
    
    if (discovery.type === 'lie') {
      this.tissue.tear(location, discovery.severity);
    } else if (discovery.type === 'truth') {
      this.tissue.burn(location, discovery.intensity);
    } else if (discovery.type === 'death') {
      this.tissue.bleed(location, discovery.consequences);
    }
    
    // Map heals wrong, creating misleading scars
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.tissue.scar(location, Math.random());
    }, this.nightDuration);
  }
  
  render() {
    // Parchment that degrades
    this.tissue.age(this.nightCount);
    
    // Draw with increasing uncertainty
    this.drawNodesWithShake(this.entropy);
    this.drawEdgesWithBlur(this.degradation);
    
    // Add new growth in dream sectors
    if (this.nightCount % 13 === 0) {
      this.tissue.growNewSection(this.unconsciousMemories);
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Degradation Engine

```javascript
class UniversalDegradation {
  constructor(world) {
    this.world = world;
    this.nightCount = 1;
    this.entropy = 0;
    this.patterns = this.loadDegradationPatterns();
  }
  
  tick() {
    this.nightCount++;
    this.entropy = Math.log(this.nightCount) * this.world.fragilityFactor;
    
    // Everything degrades differently
    this.degradeVisuals();
    this.degradeAudio();
    this.degradeText();
    this.degradeMeaning();
    this.degradeHope();
  }
  
  degradeText() {
    const stages = [
      { night: 1, transform: text => text },
      { night: 10, transform: text => this.removeAdjectives(text) },
      { night: 30, transform: text => this.removeVowels(text, 0.3) },
      { night: 50, transform: text => this.fragmentWords(text) },
      { night: 100, transform: text => this.toSymbols(text) },
      { night: Infinity, transform: text => '█'.repeat(text.length / 3) }
    ];
    
    const currentStage = stages.find(s => this.nightCount <= s.night);
    return currentStage.transform;
  }
  
  degradeHope() {
    // The most important degradation
    // Not mechanical but emotional
    // The player continues not because they believe things will improve
    // But because stopping would mean the observations meant nothing
  }
}
```

## World Implementation Examples

### World 1: Efteling (Implemented)
- **Witness**: Het Kleine Ruiter (thumb-sized ex-Bokkenrijder)
- **Resources**: Whispers, Marks, Oaths
- **Degradation**: Fairy tale logic → nightmare logic
- **Treaties**: Between fairy tale factions
- **Hidden Truth**: The park itself is on trial

### World 2: Raihappa (Monster Sketches)
Based on the grotesque sketches with sardonic taglines:

```javascript
const raihappaWorld = {
  witness: {
    name: "The Conscience Parasite",
    size: "moral_weight", // As small as guilt
    perspective: "inside_the_skull",
    motivation: "Document the exact moment humanity breaks"
  },
  
  resources: {
    ephemeral: "Justifications", // Why monsters did what they did
    physical: "Deformity Marks", // Physical evidence of degradation  
    binding: "Surrender Oaths" // Promises to become worse
  },
  
  degradation: {
    pattern: "humanity→monster→abstract→void",
    visual: "flesh→bone→shadow→absence",
    meaning: "words→grunts→silence→forgetting"
  },
  
  characters: {
    "The Beggar": {
      truth: "Was once divine, crawls to hide halos",
      tagline: "holy son of the wretched",
      resource: "Humiliation points that become power"
    },
    "The Boss": {
      truth: "Middle management literally eating subordinates",
      tagline: "thoughts on life",
      resource: "Delayed decisions that compound interest"
    }
  }
};
```

### World 3: Blood Meridian Adaptation
```javascript
const bloodMeridianWorld = {
  witness: {
    name: "The Ledger Mite",
    size: "dust_in_the_judge's_eye",
    perspective: "between_scripture_and_flesh",
    motivation: "Record violence without participating"
  },
  
  resources: {
    ephemeral: "Screams", // Last words of the dying
    physical: "Scalp Marks", // Not literal, metaphorical abandonments
    binding: "The Judge's Dictums" // Philosophy that justifies massacre
  },
  
  degradation: {
    pattern: "meaning→violence→heat→emptiness",
    visual: "sun_bleached→blood_soaked→ash→white",
    meaning: "reasons→excuses→silence→forgetting_why"
  }
};
```

## The Adaptation Wizard

### Step 1: World Analysis Interface

```

### Step 2: Witness Generation
```javascript
async function generateWitness(world) {
  // Find the most powerless character
  const characters = await world.getCharacters();
  const powerless = characters.sort((a, b) => 
    a.reputation - b.reputation
  )[0];
  
  // Make them smaller
  const witness = {
    base: powerless,
    scale: this.calculateInsignificance(powerless),
    perspective: this.findUniqueViewpoint(powerless),
    motivation: this.extractObservationNeed(powerless)
  };
  
  // Give them a reason to gather intelligence
  witness.curse = this.generateContextualCurse(world);
  witness.burden = this.createInformationNeed(world);
  
  return witness;
}
```

### Step 3: Resource Definition
```javascript
function defineWorldResources(world) {
  const conflicts = analyzeConflicts(world);
  const secrets = findSecrets(world);
  const power = mapPowerStructures(world);
  
  return {
    ephemeral: {
      name: extractEphemeralConcept(conflicts), // What fades?
      examples: generateExamples(world.narratives),
      weight: 1,
      decay: 'logarithmic'
    },
    physical: {
      name: extractPhysicalEvidence(world.locations), // What marks?
      examples: findMarkingSystems(world.objects),
      weight: 3,
      decay: 'none'
    },
    binding: {
      name: extractBindingForces(power), // What controls?
      examples: identifyOaths(world.relations),
      weight: 5,
      decay: 'corruption'
    }
  };
}
```

## The Design Manifesto

This is not a game engine. It's a **witness engine** - a system for observing worlds as they degrade, for gathering intelligence that becomes physically heavier with each truth discovered, for existing in the space between participation and observation.

Every world contains someone powerless who sees everything. Every world has information that matters. Every world degrades when observed too closely. Every world maintains itself through hidden agreements. Every world has a truth that, once known, cannot be unknown.

The Endless Nights Engine finds these patterns in any OnlyWorlds world and transforms them into playable degradation, beautiful decay, meaningful entropy.

We don't solve problems. We document them as they compound.
We don't break curses. We understand why they exist.
We don't save worlds. We witness their transformation.

The night doesn't end because ending would be mercy.
The witness doesn't grow because growth would be hope.
The knowledge doesn't lighten because forgetting would be escape.

---

*"In every world, someone small sees everything."*
*"In every night, something true becomes heavier."*
*"In every game, the real curse is understanding."*

**The Endless Nights Engine**
*For worlds that deserve witnesses*
