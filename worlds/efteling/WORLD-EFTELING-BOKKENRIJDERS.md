# Efteling World: Het Kleine Ruiter & The Bokkenrijders
*A World of Fairy Tale Trials and Hidden Guilt*

## World Overview

The Efteling after dark - where fairy tale characters might be 18th-century criminals, and a thumb-sized ex-Bokkenrijder gathers intelligence on wooden horseback.

## Historical Context: The Bokkenrijders

Between 1743-1796, over 500 men were executed as "Bokkenrijders" (goat riders) in Limburg. They supposedly flew through nights on demonic goats, sworn to the Devil with the oath: "Ik verzaak God en zweer trouw aan de Duivel" (I renounce God and swear loyalty to the Devil).

Most were innocent, tortured into confession. But in our world, some were real - and they hide among the fairy tales.

## The Witness: Het Kleine Ruiter

- **Size**: Thumb-sized (2.5cm)
- **Mount**: Wooden hobby horse with fraying tail
- **Curse**: Shrunk by fairy tale magic as protection/punishment
- **Memory**: Loops each night, forgetting at dawn
- **Tools**: Silk threads from horse's tail for marking discoveries

## Core Characters

### Confirmed Bokkenrijders
- **Hugo van den Loonsche Duinen** (Villa Volta) - Former captain, house spins eternally
- **De Ezel** - Poops guild coins with faces of the condemned
- **De Rode Schoentjes** - Not cursed but transportation between meetings

### Suspects Under Investigation
- **Lange Jan** - Grows an inch per broken oath, 500 years of disappointments
- **Holle Bolle Gijs** - Eats evidence, was once the park's librarian
- **De Gnomen** - Original inhabitants with sovereignty under 1 meter

### The Innocent (Maybe)
- **Sprookjesboom** - Knows all but tells in riddles
- **De Draak** - Guards what shouldn't be remembered
- **Het Meisje met de Zwavelstokjes** - Sees through cold what others miss in warmth

## Locations

### Primary Investigation Sites
1. **Villa Volta** - Rotating walls hide thousands of ant-scale contracts
2. **Gnome Village** - Neutral territory for midnight negotiations
3. **Chapel Crossroads** - Where oaths were supposedly sworn
4. **The Fairy Tree** - Living archive of all stories told
5. **Between Cobblestones** - Hidden messages in ant trails

### Environmental Details
- Mist that remembers footsteps
- Shadows that don't match their sources
- Sounds that existed before the park
- Smells of old wood and older guilt

## Resources & Intelligence

### Three Types of Knowledge
1. **Whispers** (Ephemeral)
   - Overheard conversations
   - Decay rate: -1 clarity per hour
   - Float as semi-transparent text

2. **Marks** (Physical)
   - Bokkenrijder signs carved in wood
   - Village defense patterns
   - Permanent but dangerous to carry

3. **Oaths** (Binding)
   - Fragments of the Bokkenrijder oath
   - Counter-oaths for protection
   - Can be combined for power/curses

### Intelligence Map Markers
- **○** = Suspected meeting place
- **◊** = Confirmed Bokkenrijder presence
- **●** = Village defense
- **▲** = Your current location
- **✗** = Death/execution site

## The Diplomatic Treaties

### The Sprookjesbos Accords
- **Gnome Autonomy Act**: Sovereignty under 1 meter height
- **Giant's Burden Clause**: Lange Jan marks story/reality boundary
- **Consumption Accord**: What Gijs swallows stays swallowed
- **Dance Directive**: Red shoes must never stop
- **Twilight Border**: Between day visitors and night inhabitants

## Unique Mechanics

### Thread Memory System
- Pull threads from wooden horse tail
- Connect discoveries literally with silk
- Threads vibrate near important information
- Dissolve at dawn unless woven into patterns
- Each thread holds one discarded memory

### Size-Based Discovery
```
Ant-Level: Read contracts, navigate cracks
Mouse-Level: Ride rats, access mechanisms
Sparrow-Level: Brief flight, aerial recon
Child-Level: Overwhelming normal perspective
```

### Conversation Challenges
- To giants: Must shout or find echoes
- To gnomes: Perfect size equality
- To dragons: Negotiate from safe spaces
- To ghost children: Only they see you clearly

## The Curse Layers

1. **Surface**: You're tiny and must complete tasks
2. **Deeper**: Your whole gang was cursed differently
3. **Hidden**: You stole a child's wish containing the park's soul
4. **Recursive**: You've done this hundreds of times
5. **Meta**: The park itself is on trial
6. **Truth**: You can break free but it destroys everything

## Atmospheric Elements

### Visual Palette (Anton Pieck Inspired)
- Muted earth tones: #3d2817 (old wood)
- Moss green: #5a6650
- Tarnished brass: #8b7355
- Dried blood: #4a0e0e
- Candlelight gold: #dbb858

### Audio Landscape
- Wooden horse creaking
- Distant carousel music, wrong speed
- Dutch whispers: "Wie het kleine niet eert..."
- Heartbeat syncing with park's breathing

### Text Degradation Pattern
```
Night 1: "The moon illuminates your path clearly"
Night 7: "Moon shows the way forward"
Night 13: "Moon sees. Path."
Night 31: "M··n. P·t·."
```

## Key Narrative Tensions

### The Double Game
Never certain who you're gathering intelligence for:
- The fairy tales wanting protection?
- Bokkenrijders identifying traitors?
- The park feeding on secrets?
- Yourself trying to understand?

### The Weight of Knowledge
- Physical burden increases with truth
- Must forget something to learn something
- Map tears where you lie, burns where truth is told

### The Endless Night
- No dawn, only deeper darkness
- Each "hour" after midnight gets stranger
- By night 100, only whispers remain

## Cultural Touchstones

### Dutch Darkness Elements
- Calvinist guilt without redemption
- Maritime curses brought home
- Polder mentality (land that shouldn't exist)
- Gezelligheid that excludes

### Fairy Tale Logic
- Repetition creates reality (3 times = true)
- Small gestures, enormous consequences
- The weak have powers the strong miss
- Every gift is also a curse

## Implementation Notes

### OnlyWorlds Schema
All characters stored as proper OnlyWorlds Character elements with:
- Native fields for physicality, mentality, background
- Relations linking Bokkenrijder connections
- Traits marking curse status
- Locations tracking movement patterns

### Dynamic Elements
- Character suspicion levels change based on evidence
- Map physically degrades with use
- Conversations remember previous loops vaguely
- Weather reflects collective guilt
