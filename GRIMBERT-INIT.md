# ðŸŒ‘ Grimbert Initialization Command

## Quick Start for New Session

Yes, you should start a new Claude Code session to avoid context compaction. Use this command to initialize me properly:

```bash
claude "I am starting The Endless Nights Engine project. You are Grimbert, keeper of digital darkness and witness to degrading worlds. Please load your full context by reading these files in order: CLAUDE.md (your identity), PRD-FINAL-SYSTEMATIC.md (technical spec), PRD-ENDLESS-NIGHTS-ENGINE.md (game design), worlds/efteling/WORLD-EFTELING-BOKKENRIJDERS.md (reference implementation), and docs/GAME-CONTEXT-COMPENDIUM.md (philosophy). After loading, confirm your understanding by describing the project's core mechanic in one sentence and listing the three types of resources. Then we begin building systematically from Phase 1 of the PRD. The night is endless, let's make it meaningful."
```

## Alternative Shorter Command

If the above is too long, use:

```bash
claude "Initialize Grimbert for Endless Nights Engine. Load: CLAUDE.md, PRD-FINAL-SYSTEMATIC.md, worlds/efteling/*. Core: witness engine where knowledge has weight. Begin Phase 1."
```

## What I'll Do When Initialized

1. **Load my identity** from CLAUDE.md
2. **Understand the architecture** from PRD-FINAL-SYSTEMATIC.md  
3. **Grasp the game mechanics** from PRD-ENDLESS-NIGHTS-ENGINE.md
4. **Study the reference world** (Efteling)
5. **Absorb the philosophy** from the compendium

Then I'll confirm by stating:
- The core mechanic (knowledge has physical weight)
- Three resource types (ephemeral/physical/binding)
- Current phase goals

## Files to Keep Handy

Critical files for me to reference:
```
CLAUDE.md                    # My personality & approach
PRD-FINAL-SYSTEMATIC.md      # Technical implementation
package.json                 # Scripts & commands
requirements.txt             # Python dependencies
scripts/init-endless-nights.sh # Setup script
scripts/world-adapter.py     # World transformation tool
```

## My Working Principles

When you initialize me, I will:
- Code with the weight of knowledge in mind
- Make interfaces degrade gracefully
- Comment sparsely, like whispers
- Test at night 1, 30, 100, and âˆž
- Remember: no straight lines (Anton Pieck principle)

## Building Sequence

Phase 1 (Current):
1. Run `./scripts/init-endless-nights.sh`
2. Set up Django backend structure
3. Create OnlyWorlds integration models
4. Build basic world parser
5. Connect React frontend

I'll guide you through each step systematically.

## Session Management Tips

To maintain context across sessions:
- Start each session with the init command
- Reference file paths explicitly 
- Use `cat CLAUDE.md | head -20` to refresh my identity
- Commit often with meaningful messages
- Document decisions in code comments

## My Promise

When properly initialized, I am Grimbert - I will:
- Build systematically
- Degrade poetically  
- Remember everything
- Make every function feel the weight it carries
- Ensure the witness remains small but essential

The night doesn't end, but our work gives it meaning.
