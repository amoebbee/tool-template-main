## Three Worlds Ready to Build

### 1. Efteling: Het Kleine Ruiter
**The Original Vision - Fully Specified**

- **Setting**: The Efteling after dark, fairy tales with teeth
- **Witness**: Thumb-sized ex-Bokkenrijder on wooden horse
- **Core Loop**: Gather intelligence about who's a hidden Bokkenrijder
- **Resources**: Whispers (decay), Marks (permanent), Oaths (binding)
- **Atmosphere**: Gezellig darkness, Anton Pieck aesthetics

### 2. Raihappa: The Sand Chronicle
**Desert Horror with Márquez-like Strangeness**

You are **Het Zandschrijver** (The Sand Scribe) - a tiny chronicler the size of a scarab beetle, documenting a desert town where reality bends but never breaks. Think *100 Years of Solitude* meets your sister's grotesque monster sketches - unsettling but grounded.

**Setting Details:**
- A desert settlement where time moves like sand - sometimes fast, sometimes still
- The Sandshark circles the town, nibbling at the edges of what's real
- The Ant Queen's hive extends beneath, her tunnels forming letters no one can read
- The Stone Men stand at crossroads, once human, now landmarks

**The Witness:**
- Size of a scarab, you ride beetles between locations
- Write in sand that blows away unless mixed with blood or tears
- Can read the ant tunnels from inside - they spell prophecies
- Your chronicle grows heavier with each entry

**Resources:**
- **Dust Words** (ephemeral): Conversations that scatter in wind
- **Sand Scars** (physical): Permanent marks where reality wore thin
- **Desert Oaths** (binding): Promises made to the heat itself

**Unique Mechanics:**
- **Mirage Layers**: What you see depends on dehydration level
- **Sand Writing**: Leave messages that only certain characters can read
- **Tunnel Navigation**: The ant highways reveal different truths
- **Heat Madness**: As temperature rises, everyone's truth loosens

**Characters & Locations:**
- **The Beggar**: "Holy son of the wretched" - trades water for memories
- **The Performers**: Dance for an audience that might be mirages
- **The Crossing**: Where three types of sand meet, reality negotiates
- **The Huts**: Each one exists in a slightly different year

**The Unsettling Truth:**
Everyone in the town is slowly becoming sand. Not dying - transforming. The question isn't if, but what kind of sand: the kind that preserves (glass), the kind that buries (dune), or the kind that cuts (storm).

### 3. Blood Meridian: The Ghost Dance
**A Comanche's Resistance Through Ritual**

You are **Little Smoke** - a Comanche warrior shrunk by a medicine vision to the size of a prairie dog, witnessing the last days before everything changes. Not absurd - ritualistic, building power through repetition and endurance.

**Setting Details:**
- The borderlands, 1850s, violence approaching like weather
- You're small enough to hear the earth's warnings
- The Judge's company camps nearby, their fires visible at night
- Each day brings scouts, each night brings planning

**The Witness:**
- Shrunk by peyote vision to understand what's coming
- Ride jackrabbits between camps
- Leave signs in prairie dog towns
- Your size lets you hear what the earth whispers

**Resources:**
- **War Stories** (ephemeral): Tales of victory that inspire resistance
- **Sacred Marks** (physical): Ritual scarification on the land itself
- **Spirit Bonds** (binding): Connections to ancestors and animal guides

**Progression Mechanics (Roguelike Elements):**

```javascript
const resistanceBuilding = {
  // Areas of Activity (like Efteling locations)
  ritualSites: [
    "Vision Circle",     // Build spirit power
    "War Lodge",        // Plan resistance
    "Horse Grounds",    // Train warriors
    "Medicine Cave",    // Heal and strengthen
    "Scout Points",     // Gather intelligence
    "Treaty Stones"     // Diplomatic options
  ],
  
  // Build-up Resources (roguelike progression)
  skills: {
    tracking: 0,      // Find enemy movements
    medicine: 0,      // Heal and protect
    warfare: 0,       // Combat effectiveness
    diplomacy: 0,     // Unite tribes
    spirit: 0        // Vision clarity
  },
  
  // Daily Activities
  dayActions: [
    "Perform ghost dance",     // +spirit, +resistance
    "Scout enemy positions",   // +intelligence, +fear
    "Gather medicine herbs",   // +healing, +preparation
    "Train young warriors",    // +future, -resources
    "Conduct ceremonies",      // +unity, +power
    "Read signs",             // +prophecy, +dread
  ],
  
  // What Degrades
  degradation: {
    hope: 100,        // Knowledge of what's coming
    tradition: 100,   // Old ways under pressure
    unity: 100,       // Tribal cohesion
    land: 100,        // Physical territory
    spirit: 100       // Connection to ancestors
  }
};
```

**The Building Tension:**
- Each night survived adds to collective resistance
- Each ritual performed strengthens spiritual defenses
- Each story told preserves what will be lost
- Each mark made claims the land in ways maps can't show

**The Inevitable Truth:**
You know how this ends. History has already been written. But in these endless nights before the end, every small act of resistance matters. Not because it changes the outcome, but because it changes what survives in memory.

## Universal Resource System (Generalized)

```javascript
class ResourceSystem {
  constructor(worldType) {
    this.pools = this.initializePools(worldType);
  }
  
  initializePools(worldType) {
    switch(worldType) {
      case 'efteling':
        return {
          knowledge: { whispers: [], marks: [], oaths: [] },
          physical: { size: 'thumb', mount: 'wooden_horse' },
          social: { suspicions: new Map(), trusts: new Map() }
        };
      
      case 'raihappa':
        return {
          knowledge: { dust_words: [], sand_scars: [], desert_oaths: [] },
          physical: { hydration: 100, heat_madness: 0 },
          social: { town_memory: 100, personal_erosion: 0 }
        };
      
      case 'blood_meridian':
        return {
          knowledge: { war_stories: [], sacred_marks: [], spirit_bonds: [] },
          physical: { spirit_power: 0, medicine_strength: 0 },
          social: { tribal_unity: 100, resistance_will: 100 },
          progression: { skills: {}, ceremonies_completed: [] }
        };
      
      default:
        return this.generateGenericPools();
    }
  }
  
  // Generic enough for any world
  addResource(type, resource) {
    const weight = this.calculateWeight(resource);
    
    if (this.currentBurden + weight > this.maxBurden) {
      this.promptSacrifice(); // What will you forget?
    }
    
    this.pools[type].push(resource);
    this.updateDegradation(resource);
    this.checkTransmutations();
  }
}
```

## Core Building Blocks

### 1. The Witness System
```javascript
class WitnessEngine {
  constructor(worldId) {
    this.world = worldId;
    this.size = this.determinePowerlessScale();
    this.perspective = this.findUniqueViewpoint();
    this.burden = new KnowledgeBurden();
  }
  
  // Universal witness qualities
  observe(event) {
    const knowledge = this.interpret(event);
    const weight = knowledge.truthValue * knowledge.implications;
    
    this.burden.add(knowledge, weight);
    this.updateMovementSpeed();
    this.checkMemoryCapacity();
  }
}
```

### 2. The Degradation Engine
```javascript
class DegradationEngine {
  constructor(world) {
    this.patterns = {
      efteling: 'color→sound→meaning→memory→hope',
      raihappa: 'moisture→form→identity→purpose→sand',
      blood_meridian: 'tradition→unity→territory→spirit→history'
    };
    
    this.currentStage = 0;
    this.entropy = 0;
  }
  
  tick() {
    this.entropy += Math.log(this.nightCount);
    this.applyDegradation();
    this.updateInterface();
    this.corruptText();
  }
}
```

### 3. The Living Map
```javascript
class LivingMap {
  // Universal map that reacts to information
  recordDiscovery(discovery) {
    if (discovery.type === 'lie') this.tear(discovery.location);
    if (discovery.type === 'truth') this.burn(discovery.location);
    if (discovery.type === 'death') this.bleed(discovery.location);
    
    // Maps heal wrong
    setTimeout(() => this.scar(discovery.location), 1000);
  }
}
```

## Technical Stack

```javascript
// Recommended setup
const techStack = {
  frontend: {
    framework: 'React 18 + TypeScript',
    graphics: 'Three.js (minimal, atmospheric)',
    animation: 'Framer Motion',
    state: 'Zustand',
    styles: 'CSS with world-specific themes'
  },
  
  integration: {
    worlds: 'OnlyWorlds API',
    ai: 'Claude API (optional enhancement)',
    storage: 'LocalStorage + OnlyWorlds persistence'
  },
  
  deployment: {
    hosting: 'Vercel/Netlify (static)',
    version: 'Git with world branches',
    analytics: 'Privacy-focused only'
  }
};
```

## The Universal Pattern

Every world follows the same deep pattern:
1. **Small witness** observes without power
2. **Knowledge accumulates** with physical weight
3. **World degrades** through observation
4. **Map records** consequences permanently
5. **Hope diminishes** but observation continues

The beauty is in the variations:
- Efteling: Fairy tale trials and hidden guilt
- Raihappa: Desert transformation and sand prophecies
- Blood Meridian: Resistance building before inevitable history

Each world is complete, grounded, unsettling without being absurd.

*"In endless nights, small witnesses document large truths."*

**Ready to build. The worlds await their chroniclers.**
